You have probably thrown away food at least a few times in your life. Chucking a withered apple or last week’s leftovers might not seem like a big deal, but over time, food waste adds up. Imagine how much food we throw away in a year.<br>

In 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency’s estimate for residential food waste was 338 pounds per household. When food waste occurs at home, it is usually because food has gone bad or there is too much of it that can’t be finished.<br>

Wasting food has several negative impacts.<br>

First, the energy and resources that go into the production, transportation and sale of food are wasted when that food is uneaten and thrown away. Furthermore, you are losing money when you pay for food that you’ll eventually toss out.
<br>
Food waste also has environmental repercussions. When billions of pounds of food end up in landfills, they decompose and release the greenhouse gases, methane and carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming.
The bottom line is that food waste is a serious problem that we can and should work to solve. Although much of food waste also happens during the production process and in stores and restaurants, you can make a difference at home by following these tips.

          <h4>Freeze food</h4>

If you can’t eat the food right away and it may spoil soon, freeze it and use it sometime in the near future. For example, if you freeze ripe berries and other fruits, you could later whip them up into a smoothie.
            <h4>Clean out the fridge</h4>

If there is already food in your fridge that is still safe to consume, try to use it before throwing it out or buying more food that will crowd the shelves. Fruits and vegetables that create ethylene gas, like peaches and tomatoes, will ripen quickly and can cause other produce to ripen faster too. This can lead to spoilage, so separate produce that creates ethylene from produce that is affected by it.
